**Hello everyone,**  

I am **Subramanyam Sahoo**. I completed my **Master‚Äôs** in **Artificial Intelligence**  from **NIT Hamirpur** in **2024** , where I had the privilege of being guided by **Dr. (Mrs.) Kamlesh Dutta**. During my time there, I worked on a diverse range of problems spanning **Computational Economics, Neural Machine Translation, and Explainable AI**. My M.Tech thesis explored the intersection of **Explainable AI and Neuroscience**.  


## Note :

### - Accepted by Apart Research for **Apart Lab Studio** program for my project ‚Äî ‚Äú(HckPrj) Mechanistic Judging and LLM Routing: Evaluation, Task-Specific Vulnerabilities, and Exploitable Failure Mode‚Äù ‚Äî developed during the Apart X Martian Mechanistic Interpretability Hackathon [Project Link](https://apartresearch.com/project/mechanistic-judging-and-llm-routing-evaluation-taskspecific-vulnerabilities-and-exploitable-failure-mode-751n)

## Independent Projects 

- ### 1. RL for Sanskrit OCR [Codes](https://github.com/SubramanyamSahoo/RL-for-Sanskrit-OCR/tree/main)
- ### 2. Implementation of GRPO on an LLM playing Wordle Task [Codes](https://github.com/SubramanyamSahoo/LLM-playing-Wordle)
- ### 3. Implemented GRPO on a Qwen model [Codes]([https://github.com/SubramanyamSahoo/LLM-playing-Wordle](https://github.com/SubramanyamSahoo/GRPO-on-Qwen/blob/main))

- ### 4. Legal AI - [Dataset](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/nlp-fairness-for-india.) , [Codes](https://github.com/SubramanyamSahoo/PreCog-Task)
Analyzed and quantified social bias exhibited by BERT and word2vec models, particularly focusing on bias in large language models (LLMs). Identified patterns in prompt distributions, providing insights into how different prompts influence model outputs. Assessed the model's exposure to biased legal documents in the context of Legal AI, specifically analyzing the impact on Google's Gemma-2 9 Billion model. Developed a metric to compare bias between the LLMs

## People are always curious about my long hair, and I tell them, "If he can rock long hair while revolutionizing AI, who am I to defy genius aesthetics? I mean, it‚Äôs basically a hairstyle for intellectuals, right !!! Just trying to keep up with the smart crowd!"

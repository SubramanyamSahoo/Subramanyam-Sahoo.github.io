**Hello everyone,**  

I am Subramanyam Sahoo. I completed my Masterâ€™s in Artificial Intelligence from NIT Hamirpur in 2024, where I had the privilege of being guided by **Dr. (Mrs.) Kamlesh Dutta**. During my time there, I worked on a diverse range of problems spanning **Computational Economics, Neural Machine Translation, and Explainable AI**. My M.Tech thesis explored the intersection of **Explainable AI and Neuroscience**.  

Prior to that, I earned my **B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering (with Honors)** from **Parala Maharaja Engineering College** (a government institution under BPUT, Odisha, India), where I was fortunate to be mentored by **Dr. Debasis Mohapatra**.  

Looking forward to connecting and collaborating!  ðŸ˜Š


Currently I am more focused into **"AI safety and Alignment"**. I plan to explore several key areas, including (but not limited to) 
- Scalable Oversight/Control 
- AI Governance/Policy
- Mechanistic Interpretability

I mean, itâ€™s basically a hairstyle for intellectuals, right !!! Just trying to keep up with the smart crowd!"
